# pca-model-error-visualization
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a comprehensive visualization of Logistic Regression classification results on PCA-transformed data. The key feature of this notebook is the diagnostic visualization techniques used to highlight and analyze misclassified test samples based on their model confidence. Key FeaturesPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA): Data is reduced to two principal components (PC1 and PC2) for 2D plotting. Decision Boundary Visualization: The Logistic Regression decision boundary is mapped onto the 2D PCA space. Model Confidence Mapping: All test points are colored using a diverging color map (RdBu) based on P(Class=1), clearly showing model certainty. Three Visualization Styles: The notebook generates three distinct plots for comparative analysis. 1.Simple Prediction Display: Standard plot showing model confidence and black marker edges. 2.Summary Error Display: Uses bright Green Rings to highlight all misclassified samples. 3.Hybrid Diagnostic Display: Uses a Yellow-to-Dark Red color map (OrRd) to shade misclassified markers/rings, indicating the Error Confidence (how strongly the model predicted the wrong class).
